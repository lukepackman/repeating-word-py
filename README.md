# First Repeated Word

Given a sentence as a string, find the first repeated word in the string.

* Assume that all sentences are nicely formed with only alphabetical characters [a-zA-Z] and with single spaces.
* Assume that a sentence will always have a repeated word.
* A repeated word is when a word occurs more than once in a sentence provided the comparison is case sensitive. For example, had != Had.
